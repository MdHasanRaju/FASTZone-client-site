      "As the British automaker’s quickest and most powerful series-produced car ever, the 2016 Lotus Evora 400 is light to boot. Starting from $89,900, the Lotus Evora 400 makes a return to the Hagerty Hot List and owners will get to enjoy 400 horsepower and 302 pound-feet of torque, giving it a zero-to-60 time of 4.1 seconds and a top speed of 186 mph.",

      "The Dodge Viper is on its way out and as one of America’s most iconic sports cars, it’s no surprise it’s being named a collectible. With nearly every sports car turning to forced induction for enhanced performance and fuel economy, the Viper is unique because it still uses a naturally aspirated 8.4-liter V10 engine. It’s going to be a sad day when the Viper ceases to exist, but hopefully the American automaker has something up its sleeves to replace it.",

    description:
      "There was little reason not to be excited when the Porsche Cayman GT4 was unveiled, because it borrows components from the 911 GT3 to make it a serious track-capable street car. Not only is it stylish, but the 3.8-liter flat-six engine pumps out 385 hp. More importantly, it has a six-speed manual transmission, making it a purist’s dream. Also keep in mind that classic Porsches typically fare very well in the collector car market and it’s likely the Cayman GT4 will be part of that group in a couple decades.",

      "The Alfa Romeo 4C Spider shows that sports cars don’t have to be packed with complicated technology and fancy bits to be fun-to-drive. The folks at Hagerty “love the pureness and simplicity of the 4C,” and we believe if you ever have the opportunity to climb in the driver’s seat, you’d agree. It is predicated that well-preserved examples of the Alfa Romeo 4C Spider will “dominate the vintage races in the future.”",

      "TThe Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 is already badass enough, but the GT350R takes things to an even more extreme level. Doing everything it possibly can to save weight, the GT350R tosses out the rear seats and a ton of other amenities, while carbon fiber wheels are bolted on all four corners to make it one serious track car. Hagerty considers the Shelby GT350R a “shoe-in” for collector car status, especially when you look at the Shelby GT350R from the 1960s and the Mustang Cobra R from 1993.",

      "For a while, enthusiasts had reason to worry that BMW might have lost its touch. The current-generation M3 and M4 are potent sports cars, but they simply don’t scream excitement like previous models. The M2, however, is an entirely different story. One look at that front end and you know it means serious business. With a 3.0-liter turbocharged six-cylinder engine providing 365 hp and 343 lb-ft of torque, this might be legitimately be an ultimate driving machine.",

The latest sixth-generation Chevrolet Camaro SS retains a V8 engine pushing out 455 hp, although the standard model can be had with a turbocharged four-cylinder or V6. We can only hope that the Ford Mustang vs. Chevrolet Camaro debate lives on for a few more decades, as each automaker continues to step up their game in order to outdo one another.",
